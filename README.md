# ThortfulChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.5.

## Development server

Run `npm run start_app` for a dev server.I made it open and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Tests

Tests were automated on doing `ng g c name_of_the_component` I'm a newbie when it comes to unit tests.

## What would I add or improve if I had the time ( I work atm )

Improve:
- CSS, everywhere.
- Cart and stripe checkout, I probably could have customized it more
- Improve the pizza builder, its a but sketchy and *clunky*
- Better quality of code and therefore services and how I treat data
  
Add:
- Throw in some animations, from angular and so on
- More data and validations for reactive forms etc
- Implement an offline part
- Set more local files and fonts and css so it works on offline mode
- Unit tests, and learn them

Its not my best project but I think I've did a good job going through almost everything you can do on the daily basis on an angular project, of course there are many more things that I wish to know and learn too!

## I've used
- Bootstrap
- Angular (material, forms, router, common, core)
- Stripe
- Chart.js
